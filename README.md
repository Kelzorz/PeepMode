# PeepMode
## Introduction
This GitHub repository serves as a replacement for the [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/e1dx04lwdewngjp/AADw2ajP6x9YxOVt51MpbRTHa?dl=0) of jcraigk, the author of the PeepMode triggers. The triggers in the dropbox have a few bugs, this repository includes newer triggers which fixes the majority of those bugs.
